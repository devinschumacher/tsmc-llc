    <h1>About TSMC, LLC ("SERP")</h1>
    <p>
      TSMC, LLC is a diversified digital brand specializing in creating and growing online business ventures. Founded in August 2023, TSMC serves as the parent company behind several successful digital initiatives - including the SERP family of brands, and formerly SCHUMACHER INC & SERP Agency.
    </p>
    <h2>SERP Agency</h2>
    <p>
      Our story began in April 2019 with the creation of SERPCO, LLC - also known as SERP Agency â€” a digital marketing agency dedicated to helping businesses thrive online. Under the leadership of co-founder Devin Schumacher, SERP Agency quickly flourished, achieving annual revenues between $2-$3.5 million. SERP Agency was bootstrap funded from zero to over 25 employees, successfully assisting more than 1300 businesses across 217 industries, collectively generating over a quarter-billion dollars in new revenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2024, SERP Agency was successfully sold in a multi 7-figure acquisition, marking a significant milestone. As part of this strategic transaction, ownership interests were reorganized for efficiency and optimal structuring, with TSMC, LLC becoming the main entity to represent various brands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, TSMC,LLC (operating colloquially under the trade name "SERP") continues to build upon the "SERP" brand legacy as a digital growth consultancy - offering growth & automation products and services to businesses internationally - including a sister company SERP AI - which provides artificial intelligence research and software development to create software and AI that helps power the products and services of SERP.
    </p>
    <p>
      Devin Schumacher currently operates as the CEO of TSMC,LLC and is working towards building a brand that strives to provide free education, tools and resources to anyone who is interested in artificial intelligence, programming, digital marketing, and entrepreneurship.
